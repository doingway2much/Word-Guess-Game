# Word-Guess-Game
This is a homework project for week 3 of my Georgia Tech bootcamp class

The game gets a random word from an ebject and then dispays it in "_"

The game listens for key up's and compares it against the word
once it know if the letter is there it will add it to the undeScore array

THe game will also play the song the user guessed once they win

In the end the game will reset the facts, history and user guesses
